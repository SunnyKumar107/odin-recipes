    <p>
      Pindi Chole is a very flavourful chickpea curry recipe that has no onion,
      garlic or tomatoes. It has a typical dark colour that comes from cooking
      it slowly on a cast iron pan or kadhai. Serve with bhaturas, naan or
      kulchas, this can double up as breakfast, lunch or dinner!
